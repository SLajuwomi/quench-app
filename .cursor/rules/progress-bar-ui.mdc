# Progress Bar UI & Usage Rule

## Layout & Positioning

- The progress bar must be centered horizontally in the navigation header on all onboarding screens.
- The progress bar should not stretch to fill the entire width; instead, it should have equal space on both sides, matching the margin of the back button (or a dummy view if no back button is present).
- The navigation header must use a three-part layout: back button (or dummy view), centered progress bar, and a dummy view to balance the layout.

## Styling

- The progress bar colors must match the current theme (do not change blueAccent or background colors).
- The height and border radius remain as previously defined.
- The progress bar container should use `flex: 1` and `marginHorizontal: 16` for consistent centering and width.

## Implementation

- In `NavigationHeader.tsx`, always render three children in the header row: back button (or dummy), progress bar, and dummy view.
- In `ProgressBar.tsx`, wrap the bar in a container that accepts the `style` prop for proper flex and margin handling.
- Do not override these layout or style rules in individual screens; all onboarding screens must use this shared header and progress bar implementation for visual consistency.

## Validation Checklist

1. Progress bar is always centered in the header.
2. Equal horizontal spacing on both sides of the bar.
3. Consistent width and appearance across all onboarding screens.
4. No color or height changes from the theme values.
